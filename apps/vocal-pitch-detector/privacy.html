        <h2>Privacy Policy for Vocal Pitch Detector</h2>
        <p><strong>Last updated: February 3, 2026</strong></p>
        
        <p>This Privacy Policy specifically governs the <strong>Vocal Pitch Detector</strong> Android application developed by <strong>Jotham Saiborne</strong>. This policy explains how data is handled locally on your device and the role of third-party advertising services.</p>

        <h3>1. No Personal Data Collection</h3>
        <p>Vocal Pitch Detector is designed with privacy as a priority. We do not collect, transmit, or store any personal identity information on any external servers.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No User Accounts:</strong> You do not need to create an account or sign in to use the app.</li>
            <li><strong>Offline Functionality:</strong> All core pitch detection algorithms run locally on your mobile hardware.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Sensitive Device Permissions</h3>
        <p>To perform its function as a musical and vocal tool, the App requires the following permissions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Microphone Access:</strong> This is used exclusively for real-time frequency analysis to detect your vocal pitch. 
                <ul>
                    <li>The audio is processed in volatile memory and is <strong>not</strong> recorded or uploaded to any server unless you explicitly choose to save a recording.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Storage (Files and Media):</strong> This permission is used only if you choose to save your pitch logs or audio recordings. These files are stored locally in your device’s internal storage and are not accessible by the developer.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Advertising and Third-Party Data</h3>
        <p>To keep the App free, we use <strong>Google AdMob</strong> for advertisements. AdMob may collect and use certain data to provide relevant ads:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Identifiers:</strong> AdMob may access your device's Advertising ID to personalize ads and analyze ad performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Usage:</strong> Please refer to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" style="color: #4da6ff;">Google’s Privacy & Terms</a> for details on how they manage ad data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Data Retention</h3>
        <p>Since we do not collect your data, we do not "retain" it. Any files you save using the App remain on your device until you manually delete them or uninstall the App.</p>

        <h3>5. Contact</h3>
